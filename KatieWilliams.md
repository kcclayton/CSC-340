## About Me
Hello! My name is Katie, and I'm a Junior majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Sustainability. I like examining the connection between technology and the environment, and I also like learning about techniques to teach media literacy! 

## My CSC340 Goals
My goals in CSC340 are to learn how to effectively use git and github, and how to work in a collaborative programming environment. I am also interested in learning how APIs work.
