# KC Clayton

## About Me
My name is KC, and I'm a Computer Science major! I'm currently in my junior year, and I haven't decided on a career path for after I graduate, but I'm leaning towards UX/UI design. 

I have a lot of different hobbies, but I enjoy reading, crochet, woodworking, and playing video games! Between that, school, and work, I don't spend time doing much else.

## My CSC-340 Goals
I'm hoping to learn some practical skills for an internship, so I hopefully don't feel completely out of my depth! I also want to grow my knowledge base and learn a lot, both of which seem achievable.
