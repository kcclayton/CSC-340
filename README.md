### Per Prof. Ntini:

A huge share of your grade will come from the [class project](https://uncg.instructure.com/courses/147396/pages/csc340-project-2?module_item_id=4340252)!

You will be required to work in pairs to develop a piece of software using methodologies and models discussed in class.

We will try to work as closely as possible to the way software is developed in the industry. Therefore, we will adopt an incremental approach to producing our software product. The culmination of this will be final project presentations during finals week, first week of May. See the class schedule for specific dates and deadlines!

While you have almost complete creative freedom on your software product, there are basic requirements that need to be fulfilled.

# You will create a software product that:
> ## Solves a real world problem       
> This means your software product needs to be targeted towards a specific demographic.
> The project will create a system to help customers locate service providers (for example: caregivers, home repair, travel agencies, online stores, healthcare, etc.) that match their needs.
       
> ## Caters to different types of users       
> Your service needs to solve problems for a diverse user class within that demographic. Each member of your group will be responsible for developing subsystems/services for a specific type of user.  (1. the customer, 2. the service provider). Each type of user will have specific services available to them.
> ### 1. Customer:
> - Create/modify customer profile.
> - View available services.
> - Subscribe to available services.
> - Write reviews for subscribed services.
> ### 2. Provider:
> - Create/modify/remove provider profile.
> - Create services.
> - View customer statistics.
> - Reply to reviews.
> ### 3. SysAdmin (if your team has 3 people):
> - Manage user access.
> - Moderate services.
> - Moderate reviews.
> - View usage statistics.
> ## Saves data persistently   
> Persistent data is data that outlives the process that created it. This means data needs to be stored so that it is not volatile and can be accessed at a later time even after restarting everything, or accessing the service from a different client. Your project will be powered by a RESTful API written in Java with a PostgreSQL database.
       
> ## Has a user interface
> We will use web pages made with HTML and CSS.   
# Good Luck!
You are REQUIRED to use GitHub for project management. Group participation will be measured against GitHub commits and grades assigned accordingly.
