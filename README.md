## Description 
> Nextdorm is a social media platform geared towards sharing information within a campus community. We find that many different departments flood students' inboxes with fliers, reminders, and notifications. Our app puts all information related to campus life and navigation in one place.
> Our goal is to make the lives of RAs, Supervisors, and Residence Life professionals much easier. We also hope to create a place for connectivity and engagement for residents.
